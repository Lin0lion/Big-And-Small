(This is a copy and paste of the Curseforge description.)

Big And Small adds mods like Avaritia that add a LOT to the game, and small mods like Mouse Tweaks. Also, please make sure you update all of the mods in the modpack along with the modloader version.

Please note this is an early Open Beta. Everything is due to change. It is guaranteed Big And Small will start crashing randomly or crash upon start-up.

If you would like, you can use this modpack in any form of media/entertainment, but please, leave a link to the modpack.

 

After you press play in the launcher, wait a minimum of ten seconds. Fabric doesn't show a process window like Forge and Neoforge do.

Please note that this is an early, unoffical open beta. It is guaranteed that the modpack will at some point start crashing randomly or crash everytime you start it up. Also, please give feedback. Every bit of information helps.



To host a singleplayer world as multiplayer with your friends:

Make sure the Essential mod is installed. 
Add them as a "friend".
Open the singleplayer world you want to play on with them.
Make sure you have the same mods.
Press [ESC] and select "Invite".
Read what has popped up and then proceed.
Set the difficulty and gamemode to what you want them to be. Select "Allow Cheats" to give yourself (you can use /op <username> to give them these commands) access to admin commands.
Now, you can have fun! Maybe look for one of Yung's structures, or maybe fight to the death in copper gear. Maybe race getting full Avaritia gear? Your choice, with 83 mods (including APIs, libraries, etc) available to play with!
